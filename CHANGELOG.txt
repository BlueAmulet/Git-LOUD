### Release 24-12-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.33
Textures 6.2

- Zulan's Hotbuild working again. See https://github.com/LOUD-Project/Git-LOUD/wiki/Zulan's-Hotbuild for more information.
- Time-based adaptive cheat can now have a lower limit in case it is working in the negative direction.
- The lobby host can now use a text field to set the default cheat multiplier for newly-added AI. A button can also be used to fill in all AI's cheat multipliers from that text field.
- WORK-IN-PROGRESS: the lobby should now display the same AI multipliers for clients as well as the host.
- Lobby settings are now more organized; the most advanced options are in their own category at the bottom.
- The LOUD standard mod list no longer includes Supreme Commander Music.
- For stabiltiy, the AI's cheat multiplier can no longer be set higher than 99, even if the user enters in 100 or higher in the lobby text field.
- Tooltips for the "Fog of War" lobby option are now more descriptive.
- Large-scale reorganization of AI unit compositions and building priorities.

### Release 18-12-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.30

- Automatic call of a console command to fix performance problems related to recent NVIDIA driver updates.
- AI multipliers can now be set via a text box.
- Time-based adaptive cheat can now work negatively, allowing an AI to become an easier opponent as the game progresses. This can make for a more potent early game -- when LOUD is normally most vulnerable -- while “levelling out” with players in the middle and later games, when LOUD’s advantages begin to add up.
- All the most advanced AI lobby options are now in their own category at the bottom of the list.
- Feedback-based adaptive cheat, when combined with time-based adaptive cheat, now works based on the current actual cheat instead of the cheat which the AI started with.
- Feedback-based adaptive cheat does not start working until 5 minutes to prevent the AI from gaining a large early advantage due to incomplete intel.
- New player colours: lime green, blue-grey, and gold.
- All darkest player colours lightened, along with greys.
- Maps which use unplayable areas no longer allow visibility or camera movement into these aforementioned areas.
- All Paragon counterparts now have the same ability list to reduce confusion.
- Unit rollover detail views now use title case when describing countermeasures in service of consistency.
- The AI now understands the difference between a map with water - and a map with water that allows naval units.
- The AI will now expand upon the map more aggressively to be more competitive with rushing players.
- The Small naval base will take precedence on smaller maps or those with a low percent of water area.
- AI: Some adjustments to maximum unit counts for various unit types.
- AI: Bombardment groups will now form at ratios of 1 or greater (down from 1.5)
- AI: Naval reinforcement requirements lowered slightly.
- AI: Improved air staging.
- AI: Improved reaction time of base distress responses.
- Base Alerts will prevent the Dead Base Monitor from closing a base until the alerts have expired. This was causing a fair number of alert units to get 'stuck' at a base that was closed during an alert.
- AI pings are somewhat less intrusive.
- AI: A very minor reduction in how much threat transport platoons will accept.
- AI: Some adjustment to bomber formations, requirements and targeting conditions, tether ranges, etc.
- AI: Reduced range on some builders, and decreased or harmonized threat parameters. 
- AI: ECO requirments for ENG Transfers increased.
- AI: Resequenced some build conditions and builds.
- AI: Lowered energy requirements for some tasks, and lowered eco requirements for certain jobs out at DP.

### Release 04-12-2020 ###
Textures 6.01
BrewLAN 0.84
Lua 5.3.28

- AI can now adapt its multiplier in response to certain factors. If the corresponding lobby global option is set to "Time-Based", the AI will increase its multiplier by 0.02 every 6 minutes. If the option is set to "Ratio-Based", all AI will increase their multipliers up to a max of 0.5 based on the relative size of their land army ratio to that of their enemies.
- New AI multiplier options: 1.45 and 2.5.

- Removed some deprecated platoon categories.
- Correct RTBLocation to keep platoons from always defaulting to the origin base.

- Reduced some mergelimits.
- Added Type 1 Land Attack formation.
- MEX Attack Large Need Mass - changed condition and local targeting priorities.
