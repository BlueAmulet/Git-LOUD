### Release 11-12-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.29
LOUD Mods 5.28
Textures 6.1

- AI can now have individual cheat multipliers, and can use adaptive cheating in different ways on an individual basis.
- To facilitate the above changes, the lobby has had a minor appearance makeover to be more compact.
- A large number of customization options for the adaptive cheat system have been added. You can now set:
  - Delay before timed cheat starts working.
  - Time in between upticks of timed cheat.
  - Amount that cheat increases every uptick under timed cheat.
  - Limit of cheat multiplier total increase under timed cheat.
  - Interval between possible changes under feedback cheat.
  - Scale of possible changes under feedback cheat.

- Details on a unit provided on mouseover of its icon have been greatly improved.
  - Conversions from metres to kilometres where range values are large enough.
  - Physics values are shown in metres per second.
  - Fuel time is shown in minutes:seconds.
  - Countermeasure readings now display their type, and exclude damage values.
  - Better fallbacks for incomplete weapon definitions.
  - DPS is now shown.
  - Some edge cases fixed concerning EMP and dummy target painting weapons.

- Lobby map previews now properly handle non-square maps.
- New set of more readable player colours.
- The Ahwassa was incorrectly overperforming when LOUD Integrated Storage was enabled, and has been brought back into line with the rest of the game balance. Users of Integrated Storage will observe the following changes:
  - Minor reductions in aerodynamic performance.
  - Health 54500 -> 52500.
  - Health regen 12 -> 10.
  - Energy build cost 895000 -> 1120000.
  - Build time 43000 -> 107400.
  - Veterancy requirements:
    - Level 1: 75 -> 90.
    - Level 2: 150 -> 180.
    - Level 3: 225 -> 270.
    - Level 4: 300 -> 360.
    - Level 5: 375 -> 450.

  - Radius of bomb damage 18 -> 14.
  - AA autocannon range 45 -> 42.
  - Wreckage mass reclaim multiplier 0.6 -> 0.3.
  - Wreckage energy reclaim multiplier 0.3 -> 0.05.
  - Wreckage health multiplier 0.3 -> 0.6.
  - Radar radius increased from 60 to 75.

- Higher limit on battleships for certain AI naval formations.
- Higher unit cap thresholds after which the AI will not build airpads or antinuke launchers.
- AI SACUs are more likely to be drawn to bases without factories than bases which have them already.
- The AI may start building new factories earlier if the conditions are suitable.
- The AI is more willing to carry out amphibious attacks.
- The AI is more willing to build naval yards if an enemy is close.
- Neutral civilians do not factor into the AI's assessment of threat anymore.
- Several bots which mistakenly had tank icons now have bot icons.
- Multiple experimentals have icons which better reflect their actual weapon loadouts.
- Default values for anti-teleportation field range.
- Numerous other bug fixes which improve the AI's capabilities.

### Release 04-12-2020 ###
Textures 6.01
BrewLAN 0.84
Lua 5.3.28

- AI can now adapt its multiplier in response to certain factors. If the corresponding lobby global option is set to "Time-Based", the AI will increase its multiplier by 0.02 every 6 minutes. If the option is set to "Ratio-Based", all AI will increase their multipliers up to a max of 0.5 based on the relative size of their land army ratio to that of their enemies.
- New AI multiplier options: 1.45 and 2.5.
- Two new units:
  - Deluge - Aeon Experimental Dreadnought, equipped with a downsized Salvation cannon and personal shield.
  - Xiphos - Cybran T3 Interdiction Gunship, equipped with potent weaponry and a rearward anti-missile system.

- The buff system now works on AI on a per-brain basis.
- Several land and amphibious platoons have received new names to indicate type.
- Platoon control value and land ratio restriction tweaks.
- Simplified some factory unit construction conditions.
- The UsingTransports flag will prevent a platoon from being considered during MERGE operations.
- New custom behaviour for torpedo bomber platoons.
- Removed some deprecated platoon categories.
- Correct RTBLocation to keep platoons from always defaulting to the origin base.
- FIX: FINDPOINTMEETSCONDITIONS was evaluating minimum threat at 'less than' rather than 'less than or equal' - resulted in failure to find positions with 0 threat.
- FIX: FINDTARGETINRANGE was not checking properly for BlockingTerrain when filtering results.
- Reduced some mergelimits.
- Added Type 1 Land Attack formation.
- MEX Attack Large Need Mass - changed condition and local targeting priorities.
- Some formation limits changed.
- Rewrite of guardpoint code. Improved guard response while on station - validated merging process.
- Buffs are now prevented from applying to civilian units.
- Revised and described most of the DEBUG switches available in LOUD.
- Some AI debug functions have been better documented.

### Release 27-11-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.27

- New and updated Naval Air formations for guarding naval flotilla with fighter, gunships and torpedo bombers.
- New behaviours for using guardpoint logic.
- Revised AttackForceAI behaviours, increasing targeting rate and general responsiveness. Searchradius has also been refined.
- AI will not build T1 p-gens if any more advanced power is under construction.
- Increased econ and time allowances for building new factories (5 mins down to 2.5).
- AI LifeThread - prevents eco crashes by compensating for any resource consumption which brings the net income below 0 when supply is empty. Tied to ACU and shuts off if the com dies.
- AI function: ClearOutBase. Directs units to new primary bases.
- Attack planner fixes, and logging additions.
- New math for exponential distance valuation when examining targets.
