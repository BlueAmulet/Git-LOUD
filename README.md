# _LOUD_ - Development.

It appears that GitHub won't allow uploads of files over 25mb.

I _was_ going to upload all the necessary files that are part of LOUD but I guess that won't happen. Instead, we can upload individual files that we have been working on and manually put them into our own .scd files for testing before sending them off to Henry for an update.
