# _LOUD_ - for Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.

This is a set of mods and a reworked AI code that has been years in the making, specifically designed to kick ass.

### Feature List:

- Cleaner and more efficient code.

A lot of the base code has been altered, adjusted or plain removed. These changes are made to vastly improve the performance of the game, whether you choose to play against the AI, or against other players. The game is garunteed to run with a much smaller memory footprint and a much faster sim speed.
- Balanced and more efficient units.

All the units from the base game and from the various mods incorporated into LOUD have been rebalanced and tweaked. Playing LOUD is quite different to the regular SupCom experience.
- Scary and more efficient AI.

The main feature of LOUD is the fucking OP AI that will really make you boil your piss in rage at how much better than you the AI is, and how much he will lay the smack down on your pretty little base (Which is nothing compared to his.). The AI of LOUD is far more effecient and a much larger challenge than any other AI modification has presented. Although challenging, the game is still entertaining, and victory is still very much a possibility.



LOUD is a labour of love, created over many years by a crazy canadian, with the assistance of various people he's hypnotized into liking this sort of torture. This GitHub page will serve as a shared repository of the latest updates and changes, as well as an up-to-date documentation and discussion on the mod and its changes.
