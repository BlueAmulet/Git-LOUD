The LOUD Integrated Storage Mod does this;

It removes ALL the standard storage units from the game and the adjacency bonuses that go with them.

Instead, all the units which would have gotten adjacency bonuses now have an additional level of upgrade at the T3 level which will give
them the full bonus as if they were surrounded by the associated buildings.   The HP of the original structure is slightly increased and
for visual indication, the upgraded buildings are slightly larger.

This mod affects,

T2 and T3 power structures
T3 Mass Extraction and T2 and T3 Mass Fabrication
T3 and Experimental Shield Structures


A secondary upshot of this mod is that you may now get the benefits of storage adjacency AND the benefits of resource adjacency for your
factories without having to juggle your building footprints.  Of course, the lone drawback to this mod is that you can no longer equip T2
mass extractors with storage.  It would have been possible to write the necessary code to allow the upgrades to be done on the earlier 
tiers, but I didn't deem it worth the effort.

In terms of game performance, the elimination of the buildings reduces unit count (which impacts sim speed) and the application and calculation
of the buffs normally associated with adjacency (which reduces memory usage).
