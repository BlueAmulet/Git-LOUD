In this file ill describe how easy it is to add your own unit descriptions for use in game.

Step 1

make a folder structure exactly like this in your mods folder

yourmodname/customize/description

in the description folder create a new lua file called

description.lua

so you now have

yourmodname/customize/description/description.lua


open the description.lua and create this table.. 

Description = {


}

you can now enter your unit descriptions to this table using the following template as an example. 

['uel0001-huk'] = "Hunker - Makes your acu Hunker.",

now our description table would look like this.. 


Description = {
	['uel0001-huk'] = "Hunker - Makes your acu Hunker.",

}

ALWAYS ADD A COMMA TO THE END OF YOUR ENTRIES!!!

This is an entry from my commander hunker mod, and is displayed then you hover your mouse
over the enhancement hunker on the enhancements panel.

you can add any descriptions you like to this table.. if an entry already exists in the table
it will not be overwritten.

This table is merged with all mods description tables before finally being merged into the real descriptions table.
