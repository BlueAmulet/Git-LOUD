Ok you might have noticed that in some descriptions, tooltips and other stuff is defined as

<LOC sometext>

i now give you the ability to define these LOC entries with ease.


Step 1

create this file structure within your mods folder.

customize/loc/

so you should now have 

yourmodname/customize/loc/



Step 2

in the loc folder create a new lua file and call it loc.lua
open the loc.lua file


step 3

in the loc.lua file create this table.

Loc = {
	DE = {

	},
	
	ES = {
	
	},

	FR = {
	
	},
	
	IT = {
	
	},
	
	US = {
			
	},

}


we are now ready to insert loc entries into this table the format of loc table entries looks like this

CybranCanHunker = "Commander, i am now able to hunker.",

ALWAYS ADD THE TRAILING COMMA WHEN ADDING ENTRIES TO THIS TABLE.. 

ive split the table up by language, so you can add the loc entries to the desired tables.. very easy.


example.. if i wanted to just add some loc info to the us table


Loc = {
	DE = {

	},
	
	ES = {
	
	},

	FR = {
	
	},
	
	IT = {
	
	},
	
	US = {
		mock = "this is just a mock loc entry.",
	},

}


NOTE: when adding loc info to any of the above tables, if the entry already exists in 
the global table it will not be replaced. so uniquely name your entries.
