Hi, 

Thank you for downloading my mod support.
i this readme ill try to explain all the details
you need to use a percific parts of the mod.

ill split it up into sections and give as much as info as possible where applicable.

first ill give a quick over view of all the functions. 

Mod support will provide help with the following functions.

1.	Textures
2.	Toggle button
3.	Ability buttons for custom abilities
4.	Unit Descriptions
5.	Loc info
6.	Enhancement slots
7.	Skins
8.	Tooltips
9.	Layouts
10.	Mfd videos


Before i get into how to do what, ill just just breifly describe some other i have added to fix/help various things


1. Template icons, when using mod support you are now able to use custom unit icons as unit construction template icons.

2. Unit view, when you hover you mouse over a unit, the unit view detail shows, you can disable this in a units blueprint
by adding DoNotShowUnitInfo = true, to the units general table.

3. if your testing a mod and you switch to a civilian army, the ui errors out, i have fixed this error.. 
you can now switch to a civilian army using ui_debugaltclick from the console and it wont error any more.



ok now for the nuts and bolts... ill split everything up into sections..
look in the readme folder for help on the things that interest you.

in all the help files ill use the UEF COMMANDER UNIT as an example in everything.. 
YOU will need to understand file hooking tecniques, i am not going to explain 
how to hook files.. you should already know this, if you dont know about hooking 
there is plenty of help available on the GPG Forums.. 

I hope you find mod support usefull, if you spot any bugs or you have
something you would like me to add to it, post in the mod support thread on the GPG Forum.

Adios.
