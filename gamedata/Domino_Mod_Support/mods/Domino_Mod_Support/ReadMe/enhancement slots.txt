
Hi, 

Ok in this help file ill describe how to add your own enhancement slot for unit enhancements.
currently the only available slots are RCH, LCH and BACK.. i now give you the ability to add
any number of your own personal slots.. 

as always i will use the UEF COMMANDER in the example.. 


STEP 1

create a file structure exactly like this in your mods folder

yourmodname/customize/enhancement_slots

now create a new lua file called enhancement_slots.lua and open this file.


Step 2

Add the following table to the enhancement_slots.lua file

Enhancement_Slots = {

	--Command Systems
	Command = {
		Icon = "/game/construct-tech_btn/m_upgrade_btn_",
		Tooltip = "Customize [Command Systems]",
	},
}


what were doing here is defining the icon for the slot and the help text 
that is displayed when we hover our mouse over the new slot.
The name of the slot is defined from the table key.. in this case command.

the path to the icon is

/yourmodname/textures/ui/faction-name/game/construct-tech_btn/m_upgrade_btn_

we DO NOT ADD THE END PART OF THE ICON NAME WHICH WILL BE UP/DOWN/SELECT/OVER.DDS

you can either make your own icon or use one of the 3 existing ones.

if you use one of your own icons, the path where the icon resides in your mods folder
has to be in "/yourmodname/textures/ui/FACTIONNAME/" and then the path you specified in the icon param above.

i have provided a set of blank enhancement slot icons for you edit, rename and place in the correct forder.
when renaming the icon be sure to keep the last part of the filename exactly like blank ones.. (after _btn_)


Step 3

Now were going to add the new enhancement slot to our unit.. we add it to the units enhancements table in the units blueprint.

so lets define the new slot.. we add the slot to the slots table.


Slots = {
	Command = {
			name = '<LOC _Command>',
			x = 5,
			y = 10,
		},
	},



we can now use this new enhancement slot as defined in the enhancements Slot param.

NOTE... when defining the enhancement slot "name" you HAVE TO USE THE SAME NAME YOU DEFINED IN STEP 2
YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE LEADING _ INFRONT OF ANY NAME PARAM. 

THATS IT!! your custom enhancement slot is ready for use.. although you wont see it on the enhancement ui until 
a unit that has an enhancement on that slot is selected.. :)
