
Hi, 

Ok in this help file ill be descibing how to add your own custom tooltips, 

tooltip referancies can be found through the games lua, 

when we referance a tooltip we can either use the loc table or just plain text it.


STEP 1

create this file structure within your mods folder

/customize/tooltips/

so you hsould now have 

yourmodname/customize/tooltips/

StEP 2

in the tooltips folder create a new lua file and call it tooltips.lua

so now you should have 

yourmodname/customize/tooltips/tooltips.lua

open the tooltips.lua file.

STEP 3

add this table to the tooltips.lua file.

Tooltips = { 
	Hunker = {
		title = "<LOC Hunker>", 
		description = "Make Your Commander Hunker.", 
	},
}

the tooltip key is Hunker.
The title uses the loc table to return the loc entry for Hunker ( please read the LOC help file on how to add custom loc info)
the description is what is show along with the tooltip title.

as an example.
this is used by enhancments in the enhancement name param
